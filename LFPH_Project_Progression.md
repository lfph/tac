# LFPH Project Progression

## I. Overview

This governance policy describes how an open source project can formally join the LF Public Health Foundation (hereafter “Foundation”) via the [Project Proposal Process](https://github.com/lfph/tac/new/main#ii-project-proposal-process). It describes the [Stages](https://github.com/lfph/tac/new/main#iii-stages---definitions--expectations) a project may be admitted under and what the criteria and expectations are for a given stage, as well as the acceptance criteria for a project to move from one stage to another. It also describes the [Annual Review Process](https://github.com/lfph/tac/new/main#iv-annual-check-in-process) through which those changes will be evaluated and made. 

Project progression - movement from one stage to another - allows projects to participate at the level that is most appropriate for them given where they are in their lifecycle. Regardless of stage, all Foundation projects benefit from a deepened alignment with existing projects, and access to mentorship, support, and foundation resources.

For more information about how your project can benefit from Foundation membership and services, please see the [LFPH website](https://www.lfph.io/join/host-your-project/).

## II. Project Proposal Process

### Introduction

This governance policy sets forth the proposal process for projects to be accepted into the Foundation. The process is the same for both existing projects which seek to move into the Foundation and new projects to be formed within the Foundation. At any point in time a project may move from one stage to another; there is no value judgement associated with which stage a project is in, but rather it is meant to be a way of aligning the resources and attention that various projects require from the TAC and Foundation.

### Project Proposal Requirements

Projects must be formally proposed via a GitHub issue (the specific process of which to be documented separately within the Technical Advisory Committees GitHub repository).

Project proposals submitted to the Foundation should provide the following information to the best of their ability:

* name of project

* project description (what it does, why it is valuable, origin and history)

* statement on alignment with Foundation charter's mission

* link to *current* Code of Conduct (if one is adopted already)

* sponsor from TAC, if identified (a sponsor helps mentor projects)

* project license 

* source control (GitHub by default)

* issue tracker (GitHub by default)

* external dependencies (including licenses)

* release methodology and mechanics (if determined)

* names of initial committers, if different from those submitting proposal

* briefly describe the project's leadership team and decision-making process

* link to any documented governance practices

* preferred stage (see stages below)

* list of project's official communication channels (slack, irc, mailing lists)

* link to project's website 

* links to social media accounts

* existing financial sponsorship

* infrastructure needs or requests 

* known or potential intellectual property encumbrances (requested or issued patents, trademarks, etc)

### Project Acceptance Process

* Projects are required to present their proposal at a TAC meeting

* All Projects must have a sponsoring TAC member to help guide it through the process. The sponsor may be identified before or after the initial presentation to the TAC.

* As a prerequisite to proceeding forward with the proposal, the TAC may ask for changes to bring the project into better alignment with the Foundation (adding a governance document to a repository or adopting a Code of Conduct, for example).

* Stage 1 acceptance follows a lazy consensus model. Advancing to, or being accepted as, Stage 2 and 3 requires a 2/3 supermajority vote of the TAC.

* The proposal document will be finalized as a project charter. This charter document must be included in the project's main repository.

* The TAC will determine the appropriate initial stage for the project. The project can apply for a different stage at any time. 

### TAC Sponsors

Every project must have a sponsoring TAC member (hereafter "TAC Sponsor") that will be identified either before or after the initial proposal is made to the TAC.

The identified TAC Sponsor for a project must not hold any financial or commercial interest in the proposed project as a protection against conflicts of interest.

The role of the TAC Sponsor is to help guide the project through meeting the minimal requirements for the project's intended stage, as well as to advocate on the projects behalf within the TAC should any needs or issues arise.

For Stage 1 and 2 projects (see stages below), the TAC Sponsor shall remain as the primary liaison for the project following acceptance as a Foundation project. Because Stage 3 projects are directly represented with a seat on the TAC, the TAC Sponsorship for such projects ends once the project is accepted. Sponsorship responsibilities also end once a project reaches Emeritus status.

## III. Stages - Definitions & Expectations

Every Foundation project has an associated maturity level. Proposed projects should state their preferred maturity level.

All projects may attend TAC meetings and contribute work regardless of their stage. 

### Stage 1 Projects

**Definition** 

Stage 1 projects are those which the TAC believes are, or have the potential to be, important to the public health ecosystem as a whole but that do not require nor request additional support from the Foundation. They may be early-stage projects just getting started, or they may be long-established projects with minimal resource needs. Stage 1 provides a beneficial, neutral home for these projects that fosters collaborative development and provides a path to deeper alignment with other Foundation projects.

**Examples**

1. New projects that are designed to extend one or more Foundation projects with functionality or interoperability libraries. 

1. Independent projects that fit within the Foundation mission and provide potential for a novel approach to existing functional areas (or are an attempt to meet an unfulfilled need).

1. Projects commissioned or sanctioned by the Foundation.

**Expectations**

The Foundation places few expectations on Stage 1 projects with regards to community size, governance, or quality controls, and such projects receive minimal support from the Foundation. While Stage 1 projects may be mature, end users should evaluate Stage 1 projects with care. 

Once accepted, Stage 1 projects will receive an annual check-in to ensure continued fit and alignment with the Foundation mission and goals, and to ensure that the project continues to meet the minimal criteria described below. Projects, or any TAC member, may also request an interim status review by submitting a report to the TAC.

**Acceptance Criteria**

To be considered for Stage 1, the project must meet the following minimal requirements:

* 1 TAC sponsors to champion the project & provide mentorship as needed

* A presentation to the TAC.

* Adherence to the Foundation's IP Policy.

* Upon acceptance, Stage 1 projects must list their status prominently on their README and website, if applicable.

* A clear connection to the Foundation’s mission and strategy.

* Add a LFPH staff member as a writer on your repository, simply to provide access to the codebase in case the maintainers cannot be contacted.

### Stage 2

**Definition** 

Stage 2 is for projects that are gaining momentum and in need of greater support from the Foundation in order to reach broader adoption or sophistication. Stage 2 projects will receive active mentorship from the TAC, greater access to Foundation staff for coaching, and are expected to actively develop their community of contributors, governance, project documentation, and other variables identified in the growth plan that factor in to broad success and adoption.

To support their active development, Stage 2 projects have a higher level of access to foundation resources, which will be agreed upon and reviewed on a yearly basis. A project's progress toward its growth plan goals will be reviewed on a yearly basis, and the TAC may ask the project to move to Stage 1 or Emeritus if progress on the growth plan drops off or stalls.

**Examples**

1. Projects that are on their way or very likely to become Stage 3 Projects.

1. Projects that have a path to growing their market adoption

1. Projects that have developed new growth targets or other community metrics for success (e.g. growing contributors, growing users, growing deployments, etc).

1. Projects that are looking to create a lifecycle plan (maintainership succession, contributor programs, version planning, etc.)

1. Projects that need more active support from the Foundation or TAC mentorship in order to reach their goals. 

**Expectations**

Stage 2 Projects are expected to establish KPIs and report regularly on the progress that is being made.

**Acceptance Criteria**

To be considered for Stage 2, the project must meet all Stage 1 requirements as well as the following:

 * Development of a growth plan and KPIs, to be done in conjunction with their TAC Sponsor.

 * Document evidence that the project is being used successfully by at least two independent end users which, in the TAC’s judgement, are of adequate quality and scope to ensure that this project has potential market appeal. High-quality end users might be government sponsored public health authorities and/or organizations dedicated to advancing community health outcomes.

 * Demonstrate a sustained flow of commits and merged contributions. There is no minimal threshold in terms of commits or contribution counts. The activity should be such that it demonstrates an ongoing, active development process that will either continue or be expected to grow in the future.

 * Demonstrate that the current level of community participation is sufficient to meet the goals outlined in the growth plan. Because "sufficient" can be subjective and differ broadly from one project to the next, the TAC Sponsor shall work with the project to establish measurable goals as part of the onboarding process.

 * Since these metrics can vary significantly depending on the type, scope and size of a project, the TAC has final judgement over the level of activity that is adequate to meet these criteria and will communicate those clearly to the project as early in the proposal review process as possible.

 * An LFPH staff member is given owner access to the GitHub organization to assist with code of conduct enforcement and any other administrative tasks.

 * Receive a two-thirds supermajority vote of the TAC to move to Stage 2. 

### Stage 3

**Definition**

Stage 3 projects are those that have achieved their growth goals as outlined in Stage 2 and are now on a sustaining cycle of development, maintenance, and long-term support with broad market appeal. Stage 3 projects commonly have well-established contributor and consumer communities, have broad alignment with the Foundation mission and goals, and can provide benefit to the Foundation due to greater direct support from the Foundation. Stage 3 project Technical Steering Committees will elect a representative to serve in a voting position on the TAC board.

**Examples**

1. Projects that have themselves become platforms for other projects.

1. Projects that have several high-profile or well known end-user implementations or deployments.

**Expectations**

Stage 3 projects are expected to participate actively in TAC proceedings. They receive ongoing financial and marketing support from the Foundation, and are expected to cross promote the Foundation along with their activities.

**Acceptance Criteria**

To graduate from Stage 1 or 2, or for a new project to join as a Stage 3 project, they must meet the Stage 2 criteria plus:

 * Have a defined governing body of at least 5 or more members (owners and core maintainers), of which no more than 1/3 is affiliated with the same employer. In the case there are 5 governing members, 2 may be from the same employer. This is to protect against any single commercial interest dominating the decision making within a project.

 * Have a documented and publicly accessible description of the project's governance, decision-making, and release processes.

 * Be able to demonstrate regular contributions from at least two organizations or otherwise unaffiliated individuals ("individual contributors"). A committer is defined as someone with the commit bit; i.e., someone who can accept contributions to some or all of the project.

 * Adopt the Foundation's Code of Conduct.

 * Explicitly define a project governance and committer process. This is preferably laid out in a GOVERNANCE.md file and references a CONTRIBUTING.md and OWNERS.md file showing the current and emeritus committers. Templates for these documents can be found in the LFPH TAC GitHub repository.

 * Have a publicly available marketing strategy that gets executed upon. 

 * Other metrics as defined by the applying Project during the application process in cooperation with the TAC.

 * Receive a 2/3 vote from the TAC to move to Stage 3. Projects can move directly from Stage 1to 3, if they can demonstrate sufficient maturity and have met all requirements. 

### Emeritus Stage

**Definition**

Emeritus projects are projects which the maintainers (or the TAC) feel have reached or are nearing end-of-life. Emeritus projects have contributed to the ecosystem, but are not necessarily recommended for ongoing development as there may be more actively maintained choices. The Foundation appreciates the contributions of these projects and their communities, and the role they have played in moving the ecosystem forward and will continue to provide a neutral home for them. 

**Examples**

1. Projects that are "complete" by the maintainers' standards.

1. Projects that do not plan to release major versions in the future.

1. A project that no longer has active maintainers.

**Expectations**

Projects in this stage are not in active development. Their maintainers may infrequently monitor their repositories, and may only push updates to address security issues, if at all. Emeritus projects should clearly state their status and what any user or contributor should expect in terms of response or support. If there is an alternative project the maintainers recommend, it should be listed on their GitHub as well. The foundation will continue to hold the IP and any trademarks and domains, but the project does not draw on foundation resources. 

**Acceptance Criteria**

Projects may be granted Emeritus status via a lazy consensus vote from the TAC and with approval from project ownership. In cases where there is a lack of project ownership, only a lazy status vote from the TAC is required.

## IV. Annual Check-In Process

The TAC shall develop an annual check-in process to determine whether projects are in the stage that accurately reflects their needs and goals.
